Password Manager
The Password Manager is a C# WPF application that allows users to generate, store, and manage their passwords securely. It provides a user-friendly interface for adding, editing, and deleting password entries, as well as generating strong passwords based on user-specified criteria.

Project Structure
The project is structured as follows:

MainWindow.xaml: 
The main window of the application, which contains the user interface elements such as text boxes, buttons, and a data grid for displaying password entries.

MainWindow.xaml.cs: 
The code-behind file for the main window, which contains the event handlers and logic for interacting with the user interface.

PasswordEntry.cs: 
A class that represents a password entry, with properties for website/service, username/email, and password.

PasswordProtector.cs: 
A static class that provides methods for encrypting and decrypting passwords using the Windows Data Protection API (DPAPI).

App.xaml and App.xaml.cs: 
The application-level XAML and code-behind files, which define application-wide resources and startup behavior.

Solutions and Features
The Password Manager application provides the following solutions and features:

Password Generation:
Users can generate strong passwords with customizable length and character sets. The generated password is displayed in the password text box and can be easily copied or saved.

Password Storage: 
Users can save password entries, including the website/service, username/email, and password, securely. The password is encrypted using the Windows Data Protection API (DPAPI) before being stored in a local file (passwords.txt).

Password Management: 
The application allows users to view, edit, and delete password entries. The password entries are displayed in a data grid, and users can select an entry to view or edit its details. Deleting a password entry removes it from the data grid and the local storage file.

User-Friendly Interface: 
The application provides a clean and intuitive user interface, following an Apple-inspired design. The input fields are displayed with placeholder text, and the password length can be adjusted using a slider. The buttons for generating and saving passwords are conveniently located and styled for ease of use.

Secure Password Handling: 
The application ensures the security of user passwords by encrypting them using the Windows Data Protection API (DPAPI) before storing them. The encrypted passwords are decrypted only when needed for display or editing purposes.

Local Storage: 
The password entries are stored locally in a file named passwords.txt. Each entry is stored as a comma-separated line, with the website/service, username/email, and encrypted password. The application loads the password entries from this file when it starts and updates the file whenever changes are made.

Usage
To use the Password Manager application:
Launch the application.
Enter the website/service, username/email, and password in the respective input fields.
Adjust the password length using the slider if desired.
Click the "Generate" button to generate a strong password based on the specified length.
Click the "Save" button to save the password entry.
The saved password entries will be displayed in the data grid below.
To view or edit a password entry, select it from the data grid, and the details will be populated in the input fields.
To delete a password entry, select it from the data grid and click the "Delete" button.

Note: The application stores the password entries locally in a file named passwords.txt. Ensure that this file is kept secure and accessible only to authorized users.
